# My VR Room
This is my first VR application.

## Environment / Software Version
- Unity 2019.4.4
- Windows 10
- Visual Studio 2019

## How to use
I checked that this application works well with VR Head Mount Display([Oculus Quest](https://www.oculus.com/quest/)). You can also play without HMD by pressing Alt and dragging your mouse(left click) in the Game view of Unity.
